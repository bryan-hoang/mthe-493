% Problem Description: By the proposal stage, you should have an application. Based on your intro/background you should be able to abstract it to your application and what your intentions are with your project (and maybe some TBL factors you will be addressing). Some will be very clear, but others may need revising as the actual application is not defined, yet (but try to be as clear as possible).
