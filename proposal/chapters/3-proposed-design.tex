% Proposed Solution/Design: You will be dealing with Modelling and Design aspects in this section. Most of your design will be done on the model you produce. The theory you have researched will contribute to making a suitable model, and ultimately what design you do on this model. Include the tools (theory, processes, and/or techniques) you will use in your project (donâ€™t forget to reference). Also, you need to consider Triple Bottom Line Factors, how they are relevant to your application and how they could influence your design. Try to be as quantitative as possible, and outline performance goals. Make sure the design aspect of your project is clear.
