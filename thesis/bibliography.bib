  abstract = {Abstract A linear mixed integer program is an optimization problem in which a nonempty subset of integer variables (unknowns) and a subset of real-valued (continuous) variables exist, the constraints are all linear equations or inequalities, and the objective is a linear function to be minimized (or maximized). After presenting several practical applications of mixed integer programming, we describe the main classes of algorithms, branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut, that are used to solve this hard class of problems. Considerable attention is paid to ways to improve solution times, involving preprocessing, reformulation with cuts and/or new variables, and heuristics.}

Heuristic algorithms often times used to solve NP-complete problems, a class of decision problems. In these problems, there is no known efficient way to find a solution quickly and accurately although solutions can be verified when given. Heuristics can produce a solution individually or be used to provide a good baseline and are supplemented with optimization algorithms. Heuristic algorithms are most often employed when approximate solutions are sufficient and exact solutions are necessarily computationally expensive.},

	title = {Optimal Task Allocation for Mobile Edge Learning with Global Training Time Constraints},
	abstract = {This paper proposes to minimize the loss of training a distributed machine learning ({ML}) model on nodes or learners connected via the resource-constrained wireless edge network by jointly optimizing the number of local and global updates and the task size allocation. The optimization is done while taking into account heterogeneous communication and computation capabilities of each learner. It is shown that the problem of interest cannot be solved analytically but by leveraging existing bounds on the difference between the optimal loss and the loss at any given iteration, an expression for the objective function is derived as a function of the number of local updates. It is shown that the problem is convex and can be solved by finding the argument that minimizes the loss. The result is then used to determine the batch sizes for each learner for the next global update step. The merits of the proposed solution, which is heterogeneity aware ({HA}), are exhibited by comparing its performance to the heterogeneity unaware ({HU}) approach.},
