We explain how this technique works and where it stems from. We analyze the related work in detail to understand the composition of modern fingerprints and see how this technique is currently used online. We systematize existing defense solutions into different categories and detail the current challenges yet to overcome.},

  abstract = {Abstract A linear mixed integer program is an optimization problem in which a nonempty subset of integer variables (unknowns) and a subset of real-valued (continuous) variables exist, the constraints are all linear equations or inequalities, and the objective is a linear function to be minimized (or maximized). After presenting several practical applications of mixed integer programming, we describe the main classes of algorithms, branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut, that are used to solve this hard class of problems. Considerable attention is paid to ways to improve solution times, involving preprocessing, reformulation with cuts and/or new variables, and heuristics.}
