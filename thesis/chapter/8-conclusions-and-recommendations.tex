    \label{ch:conclusions-and-recommendations}
    The heuristic model for solving the ILP problem of allocating data to learners was successful in matching the performance of an industry leading optimization solver. The heuristic is intended to be exact in its solution, so the parameters which create the edge cases where it does not find the global minimum need to be further examined to help improve the process to being completely exhaustive.
