    This paper explores optimizing cost in an edge computing worker pool in the application of parallel learning. An experimental setup of  heterogeneous workers charging varying fees to complete jobs is used to train a neural network. The workers are benchmarked for computational capability, and then the distribution of work is determined by a heuristic optimization algorithm. The results are combined using the federated averaging technique, and performance of the system is evaluated based on total training time, model accuracy, total cost and benchmarking accuracy. The primary investigations were finding the best method to optimize the constraint problem, and finding the best method to aggregate results from parallel learning, both judged against the aforementioned metrics. These results have impacts in research fields which have compute-intensive analysis that is paralellizable, as the results provide the foundation for cost-effective platform for computing distributed workload and ultimately speed up the progress of research in these applicable fields.
