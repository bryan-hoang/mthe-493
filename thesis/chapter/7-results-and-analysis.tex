    \section{Optimization}
    
    To test the efficacy of the heuristic optimization model, the solutions it produced to 10,000 experiments with varying parameters were compared against the solutions achieved by the Gurobi optimization tool. In 9.64\% of experiments both systems returned that there were no feasible points to the integer programming problem. Further, in all 10,000 experiments there were no disagreements between the models regarding problem feasibility. This indicates that the feasibility checks built into the heuristic model are complete.
    
    In 86.37\% of the 10,000 experiments both frameworks came to the same solution for minimal total deployment cost. This means that in cases where there was a feasible solution, both processes achieved the same optimum in 95.59\% of those cases. Since Gurobi is a widely trusted and reputable optimization engine~\cite{gurobi}, this indicates that the heuristic model is highly proficient as an optimizer.
    
    In 4.42\% of the cases where there was a feasible solution, Gurobi produced a different answer than the heuristic model. Of these,
