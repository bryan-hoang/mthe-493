    \chapter{Engineering Impact}
    \label{ch:engineering-impact}

    Modern computing has empowered all kinds of researchers and businesses to achieve incredible results with finite resources. There has been a rapid acceleration in the power of computers across the whole spectrum of devices. The demands of computing tasks have grown with the capabilities, meaning that resource efficiency will always be a relevant problem. The natural progression of solving constraint problems is to split workloads and solve them in parallel, provided that the problem can be parallelized. This has fuelled the massive growth in cloud computing from companies such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. These service platforms are convenient and easy to use, but are costly and consume tons of energy.
