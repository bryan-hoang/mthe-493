    \section{Minutes}
    \begin{items}
        \item Sara presented what is essentially a Problem Description to help refine our scope for the project. It isn't set in stone, but will be a good base for us to build on and tweak.
        \item We told Hossam about how Mansouri is helping to supervise.
        \item Based on the previous point, we'll most likely be working more often with Sara.
    \end{items}

    \section{Action Items}
    \begin{items}
        \item Sara will send the group a copy of the document she presented.
